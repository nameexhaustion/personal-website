The Y combinator, also known as the fixed point combinator, is a function that finds the fixed point of other functions.

# What are fixed points?

A fixed point of a function is some input that causes the function's output to be the same as the input itself.

In notation, <tex>x</tex> is a fixed point of a function <tex>f</tex> if:

```latex
f(x) = x
```

For example, the function <tex>f(x) = x^2</tex> has 2 fixed points: <tex>x=0</tex> and <tex>x=1</tex>.

For functions that work on numbers (i.e. <tex>f: R\rightarrow R</tex>), you can find a fixed point by solving for <tex>f(x) = x</tex>.
For example, in the case of <tex>f(x) = x^2</tex>:

```latex
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x^2 = x \\
x^2 &= x \\
x^2 - x &= 0 \\
x(x - 1) &= 0 \\
x &= 0, 1
\end{align*}
```

The idea behind the Y combinator is to find the fixed points of <em>higher order functions</em>.
Those are functions that take and return functions.
One of the interesting things that the Y combinator lets you do is to enable recursion in an environment that doesn't natively support it.
We'll see how to do this with the factorial function.

# The factorial function

The factorial function <tex>f(x) = x!</tex> may be implemented recursively in javascript like this:

```javascript
function factorial(v) {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * factorial(v - 1)
}

console.log(factorial(7)) // 5040
```

Now, the challenge is to construct a recursive factorial function without self-reference,
meaning that the factorial function can't contain a call to itself like the one above.

This is done by making a factorial function that takes 2 arguments:

- The number to compute the factorial of
- A copy of itself

```javascript
function factorial(v, fn) {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * fn(v - 1, fn)
}

console.log(factorial(7, factorial)) // 5040
```

When calling this factorial function, you pass as an additional argument a copy of itself.

How does this work?

Let's think about what the `factorial` function does:

- If `v` is `0`, return `1`
  - Otherwise, return `v` multiplied by the result of calling `fn` with `v - 1` and a copy of itself

And what does the `fn` function inside of the `factorial` do?

- It does the same thing as the `factorial` function

In fact, the `return` statement is equivalent to:

```javascript
return v * factorial(v - 1, factorial)
```

The result is a recursive factorial function that doesn't call itself, but rather a copy of itself that behaves exactly the same as itself.

What we saw was that you create a recursive function by calling it with a copy of itself.
It's actually possible to automate this so that we don't have to explicitly call `factorial` with itself every single time.

# Automating the act of calling a function with itself

First, we curry the `factorial` function, and rename it to `create_factorial`:

```javascript
const create_factorial = (fn) => (v) => {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * fn(fn)(v - 1)
}

const A = create_factorial(create_factorial)

console.log(A(7)) // 5040
```

To help understand how the above code works, let's write out what `A` evaluates to: `create_factorial` substituted into `fn`:

```javascript
const A = (v) => {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * create_factorial(create_factorial)(v - 1)
}
```

What is `create_factorial(create_factorial)`? It is in fact equivalent to `A`!
So the `return` statement becomes equivalent to:

```javascript
return v * A(v - 1)
```

which is a call `A` itself, giving you a working factorial function.

# Converting `create_factorial` to work with fixed points

The next step is trickier.
We want to make it so that we can in fact "directly call" `fn` inside of the function that `create_factorial` returns like this:

```javascript
return v * fn(v - 1)
```

instead of:

```javascript
return v * fn(fn)(v - 1)
```

Let's reason our way through this. We want to call `create_factorial` with "something" - let's name this `S`.
We'll also name the result of calling `create_factorial(S)` as `A`:

```latex
A = create\_factorial(S)
```

Here is what `A` evaluates to in javascript:

```javascript
// A = create_factorial(S)

const A = (v) => {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * S(v - 1)
}
```

It looks like `A` would be a valid factorial function if `S = A`:

```latex
S \xleftrightarrow{} A
```

And so we have:

```latex
S(v) \xleftrightarrow{} A(v) \xleftrightarrow{} factorial(v)
```

In fact, `S` in the above is actually a fixed point of the `create_factorial` function.
This is the idea behind the Y combinator - enabling recursion through indirect self-reference by using a fixed point.

We'll allow direct self-reference for now to make it easier to work with.
According to the above equivalence, `A` should call `create_factorial` with itself:

```javascript
const A = create_factorial(A)

// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'A' before initialization
```

Except that it doesn't work, because javascript (and most programming languages) immediately evaluate expressions.
When reaching the above line, javascript will try to evaluate what `A` is.
Since `A = create_factorial(A)`, it will then to evaluate `create_factorial(A)`, however this won't work
because `A` has not yet been defined.
This is known as [eager evaluation](https://www.google.com/search?q=eager+vs+lazy+evaluation).

To get around this, we wrap the the argument for `create_factorial` in a closure:

```javascript
const A = create_factorial((v) => A(v))
```

Here `S = (v) => A(v)`.
You can see how this is valid since calling `S` with some number `v` is equivalent to calling `A` with `v`.
Now, when javascript evaluates the statement, `create_factorial` is called with a function `(v) => A(v)`.
The content of this function is only evaluated when it is called, at which point `A` will have been defined.

# Completely removing self reference

Currently, our definition of `A` makes use of self-reference, and our next step is to get rid of that.
We've saw earlier how to do this with the `create_factorial` function, and this is no different.

First, we'll curry `A`, and replace all calls to `A` from inside itself with `fn(fn)`:

```javascript
const A = (fn) => {
  return create_factorial((v) => fn(fn)(v))
}
```

To finish, we call `A` with itself so that `fn = A`, and check the result:

```javascript
const create_factorial = (fn) => (v) => {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * fn(v - 1)
}

const A = (fn) => {
  return create_factorial((v) => fn(fn)(v))
}

const F = A(A)

console.log(F(7)) // 5040
```

It works! We've successfully replaced the call to `fn(fn)` with a call to `fn`.

This is a lot of effort to change a minor thing - we could have stuck with using `fn(fn)` and saved ourselves the trouble.
However, what this lets us do is to directly derive to Y combinator, which is now only a few formatting steps away.

# Deriving the Y combinator

First, we convert variable names (`fn` to `x` and `A` to `Z`) and convert to an arrow function:

```javascript
const Z = (x) => create_factorial((v) => x(x)(v))
```

Converting to an [IIFE](https://www.google.com/search?q=immediately+invoked+function+expression):

```javascript
const Z = ((x) => create_factorial((v) => x(x)(v)))((x) => create_factorial((v) => x(x)(v)))
// the above is equivalent to:
let Z = ((x) => create_factorial((v) => x(x)(v)))
Z = Z(Z)
```

The above is `((x) => create_factorial((v) => x(x)(v)))` repeated twice.
The first one for the function definition, the second one for the argument we call it with.
In this case we're calling it with a copy of itself.

Finally, instead of only working on the `create_factorial` function, we curry this and replace `create_factorial` with an argument `f` so that we can pass it any function:

```javascript
const Z = (f) => ((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))
```

Double checking:

```javascript
const create_factorial = (fn) => (v) => {
  if (v == 0) {
    return 1
  }

  return v * fn(v - 1)
}

const Z = (f) => ((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))

const factorial = Z(create_factorial)

console.log(factorial(7)) // 5040
```

So now, for any function in the same format as our previous factorial function, `Z(f)` enables recursion for it.
Specifically, `Z(f)` gives you the <em>fixed point</em> of the function. i.e.

```latex
Z(f) \xleftrightarrow{} f(Z(f))
```

# The Z combinator

The `Z` we have above is actually named the Z combinator, which is a form of the Y combinator adapted to work with eagerly evaluated languages.
To see this, it helps to know some python - we'll first convert our javascript code to python.

```javascript
const Z = (f) => ((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))((x) => f((v) => x(x)(v)))
```

In python:

```python
Z = lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))(lambda x: f(lambda v: x(x)(v)))
```

Finally, we'll convert the python code to a lambda calculus expression:

```latex
Z = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f(\lambda v.xxv))(\lambda x.f(\lambda v.xxv))
```

[You'll find the exact same statement on the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Strict_fixed-point_combinator).

# The Y combinator

Finally, the [Y combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator)
is a more "relaxed" Z combinator that doesn't explicitly define the extra <tex>\lambda v</tex> in the body:

```latex
Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f(xx))(\lambda x.f(xx))
```

# Conclusion

Hopefully, my explanation of the Y combinator was clear to follow and understand.
The Y combinator doesn't have much (if any) practical application in today's world,
but trying to understand it can be good exercise for logical thinking.

The Y combinator is somewhat similar to in feel to topics such as the
[diagonal lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma),
[incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)
and [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).
Very similar methods are used in these areas to prove fundamental results in logic,
as all of these stem from the idea of <em>"self-reference"</em> - having the ability to refer to oneself.
