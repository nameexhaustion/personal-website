The Y combinator, also known as the fixed point combinator, is a function that finds the fixed point of other functions.

##### What are fixed points?

A fixed point of a function is some input that causes the function's output to be the same as the input itself.

For example, for the function <tex>f(x) = x</tex>, all inputs are fixed points, since the function simply returns what it was given.
Mathematicians have a fancy word for a function that simply returns what it was passed - the "identity" function.

On the other hand, for the function <tex>f(x) = x^2</tex>, the function only has 2 fixed points <tex>x=0</tex> and <tex>x=1</tex>.

For functions that work on numbers (i.e. <tex>f: R\rightarrow R</tex>), you can find a fixed point by solving for <tex>f(x) = x</tex>.
For example, in the case of <tex>f(x) = x^2</tex>:

```latex
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x^2 = x \\
x^2 &= x \\
x^2 - x &= 0 \\
x(x - 1) &= 0 \\
x &= 0, 1
\end{align*}
```

The idea behind the Y combinator is to find the fixed points of <em>higher order functions</em>.
Those are functions that take and return functions.
One of the interesting things that the Y combinator lets you do is to enable recursion in an environment that doesn't natively support it.
